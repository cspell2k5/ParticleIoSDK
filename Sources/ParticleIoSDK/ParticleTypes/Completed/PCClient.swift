/// An OAuth client generally represents an app. The Particle CLI is a client, as are the Particle Web IDE, the Particle iOS app, and the Particle Android app. You too can create your own clients. You should create separate clients for each of your web and mobile apps that hit the Particle API.Some requests, like generating an access token, require you to specify an OAuth client ID and secret using HTTP Basic authentication. Normally, when calling the Particle API as a single developer user to access your own account, you can use particle for both the client ID and secret as in the example above for generating an access token. However, especially when you are creating a product on the Particle platform and your web app needs to hit our API on behalf of your customers, you need to create your own client.NEVER expose the client secret to a browser. If, for example, you have a client that controls all your organization's products, and you use the client secret in front-end JavaScript, then a tech-savvy customer using your website can read the secret in her developer console and hack all your customers' devices.
